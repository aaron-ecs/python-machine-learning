# python-machine-learning
An introduction to the machine learning library `sklearn` which comes with Python.

The example in this project uses the supervised learning naive bayes algorithm.

## Data
The dummy data represents membership data and has a flag if these members purchased a hero product.

We have set two patterns in this data which is 35% of members who have purchased this product have a salary over Â£70,1234 and 25% of these members recently bought product 2024. 

## Machine Learning
70% of the data is used to create the ML model. Then model is tested with the remaining 30%.

The accuracy should be 70% or greater.

## Results
The remaining 30% of data was tested and below are the results:

True Negatives:     21
 
True Positive:      6

False Positives:    0

False Negative:     4
